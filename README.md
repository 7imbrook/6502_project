# 6502 Assembly and Linking
I've recently gotten back into working on my Ben Eater 6502 project and I want to start building out some more robust toolchains for working with it. I love that Ben focuses on the most minimal example need to make the understanding easy, but for me I love seeing how far I can push it (and I've pushed it too far). 

Starting with just assembly and linking, but this will start having c and maybe even someday rust. Ask quetions, comment on code, help me learn and I hope that I can keep this documented enought that it helps you learn too.
